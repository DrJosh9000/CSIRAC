# CSIRAC

A work-in-progress Go implementation of CSIRAC, as described in [The Last of the First - CSIRAC: Australia's First Computer](https://pearcey.org.au/assets/Museum/Last-of-the-First-CSIRAC-Australias-First-Computer.pdf).
The intention is to run in the browser via WebAssembly, making CSIRAC accessible
to anyone with a modern browser.
